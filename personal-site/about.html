                My name is Sophia. I'm from Texas, but recently moved to Oregon. Most of the time you can find me sleeping, hiking, or cooking. I love decorating my everyday items and personal space to be as cute and personalized as possible! I have a weenie dog and boyfriend that I spend all my time with.

           I taught myself HTML coding when I was 12. I didn't know you could turn it into a career until a few years ago.I aspire to get a job in the tech industry so that I can work remotely and spend even more time with my loved ones.
